# Web-Browser-History
Java program that simulates how a web browser visits webpages, especially how the back button shows the previous webpage visited and how the forward button shows the next webpage. 

Stacks are used to keep track of both the forward history and the backward history. The stacks are backed by a linked list and an array separately to view the pros and cons (running times) of backing a stack with either.
